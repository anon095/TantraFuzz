TantraFuzz moves beyond static scanning by embodying the cyclical and interconnected nature of the Tantric path. It is a dual-tool suite composed of a Recon Engine that sees, and a Fuzzer that attacks. The eyes guide the fists.üïâÔ∏è The PhilosophySankalpa (Intention): The focused intent to bypass, uncover, and exploit vulnerabilities through deep understanding.Yantra (Structure): A modular, dual-tool architecture that acts as a force multiplier, separating reconnaissance from exploitation.Mantra (Payload): Each payload is a specific vibration, intelligently crafted and mutated by AI to deceive, bypass, and penetrate defenses.Tantra (Continuum): The infinite loop of real-time discovery, contextual analysis, AI-driven mutation, and adaptive attack until success is achieved.Bindu (Singularity): The ultimate point of a successful bypass or exploit, achieved through persistent, intelligent effort.üèóÔ∏è Core ComponentsThe framework is comprised of two powerful, symbiotic Go binaries.‚Ö†. tantrafuzz-recon (The Eyes)A supreme-level reconnaissance engine designed to build a deep, comprehensive understanding of the target's attack surface.Key Features:‚úÖ Live "Deep Dive" Enumeration: Queries multiple real-world APIs (crt.sh, AlienVault OTX, Wayback Machine) for legitimate, accurate subdomain and endpoint data.‚úÖ Persistent Monitoring: A monitor mode connects to real-time Certificate Transparency Log streams to discover new subdomains the moment they are created.‚úÖ Stateful Awareness: Utilizes an embedded database (BadgerDB) to store scan results, enabling powerful change detection to identify new assets over time.‚úÖ AI-Assisted Expansion: Leverages the Gemini AI to predict and discover likely subdomain patterns based on target context.‚úÖ Deep Intelligence Gathering: Concurrently fingerprints WAFs, server technologies, and parses JavaScript files for secrets and hidden API endpoints.‚úÖ Structured Output: Generates detailed JSON reports that serve as the "battle map" for the fuzzing engine.‚Ö°. tantrafuzz (The Fists)A recon-driven, behavioral-adaptive fuzzing engine that uses the intelligence gathered by the recon tool to launch hyper-aware, intelligent attacks.Key Features:‚úÖ Recon-Driven Targeting: Ingests the JSON report from tantrafuzz-recon to automatically identify and attack every discovered endpoint and parameter.‚úÖ Behavioral-Adaptive Mutation: The core of the fuzzer. It analyzes why a payload fails (e.g., "Blocked by Cloudflare," "Reflected in JSON") and feeds this context to the AI.‚úÖ Recursive AI Loop: If an initial payload fails, the Gemini AI is invoked to generate a superior, mutated payload specifically designed to bypass the detected defense in the observed context. The attack is then re-launched.‚úÖ Context-Aware Payloads: The AI considers the detected WAF, backend technologies, and reflection context when crafting new bypasses.‚ö° The Tantric Workflow: Recon-to-ExploitThe framework is designed to be used in a sequential pipeline for maximum effectiveness.+---------------------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------------------+

üöÄ Installation & BuildThe framework is written in pure Go and is easy to build from source.Clone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/anon095/TantraFuzz.git](https://github.com/anon095/TantraFuzz.git)
cd TantraFuzz
Install Dependencies:go mod tidy
Build the Binaries:This command will create the two executable files in your project root.go build -o tantrafuzz ./cmd/tantrafuzz/
go build -o tantrafuzz-recon ./cmd/tantrafuzz-recon/
‚öôÔ∏è ConfigurationThe framework requires a Google AI (Gemini) API key for its AI-powered features.Set Environment Variable: The API key must be provided as an environment variable for security.export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_REAL_API_KEY_HERE"
üïπÔ∏è Usage GuideStep 1: Deep Reconnaissance ScanRun tantrafuzz-recon to perform a one-off, deep-dive scan on your target../tantrafuzz-recon -d testphp.vulnweb.com -o testphp.json -v --ai-assist --deep-js
--domain: The target to scan.--output: The file to save the final JSON intelligence report.--verbose: Shows real-time discovery logs.--ai-assist: Enables AI for subdomain suggestions.--deep-js: Enables JavaScript mining for secrets and endpoints.Step 2: Launch the Adaptive FuzzerFeed the intelligence report from Step 1 directly into the tantrafuzz fuzzer../tantrafuzz --recon-file testphp.json -v sqli --ai-mutate
--recon-file: The intelligence report to use for targeting.-v, --vuln-type: The class of vulnerability to test for (e.g., sqli, xss).--ai-mutate: Enables the recursive AI mutation loop if initial payloads fail.(Optional) Step 3: Persistent Real-Time MonitoringTo continuously watch a target for new assets, run the recon engine in monitor mode../tantrafuzz-recon monitor -d testphp.vulnweb.com --db-path ./testphp_db -v
monitor: The sub-command to activate real-time mode.--db-path: The directory to store the persistent database for change detection.ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!

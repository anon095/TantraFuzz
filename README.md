echo '# 🔥 TantraFuzz 🔥

> An AI-powered offensive security framework based on Tantric principles.

TantraFuzz is an advanced tool for web application security testing that embodies the cyclical and interconnected nature of the tantric path. It moves beyond simple, generic payloads towards a context-aware, technique-driven methodology, using AI to evolve its attacks in real-time.

## 🕉️ The Philosophy

- **Sankalpa (Intention):** The focused intent to bypass, uncover, and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Yantra (Structure):** A modular, geometric framework that acts as a force multiplier.
- **Mantra (Payload):** Each payload is a specific vibration, a mantra designed to deceive, bypass, and penetrate defenses.
- **Tantra (Continuum):** The infinite loop of recon, mutation, attack, analysis, and AI-driven evolution until success.
- **Bindu (Singularity):** The ultimate point of a successful bypass or exploit.

## 🏗️ Yantra (The Sacred Architectural Blueprint)

The framework''s structure is a logical, modular *yantra* that separates resources for discovery from those for exploitation.
